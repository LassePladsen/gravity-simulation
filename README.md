Simple Python gravitational simulation using Newton's law of gravity, inspired by the netflix show 3 body problem.
Supports all the parameters you would want to adjust, like how many bodies, the masses, initial conditions etc.

# Installation
Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LassePladsen/gravity-simulation.git
```

Install the dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can either import the module with
```python
from gravity_sim_2d import GravitySim2D 
```
or use it directly in the module `gravity_sim_2d.py`.

See `gravity_sim_2d.py` for example usage.
